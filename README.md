### mmu-java
project which simulate the computer mmu algorithm.
this project is divided into some parts:
### part 1
at this part I built the basic parts of the mmu - algorithms whose role is to advise the mmu how to paginate the pages
### part 2
at this part I relized the two parts of main and cache, and added the implement of the algorithms from part 1 in order to manage memory, as operating system does
### part 3
at this part I added a system which activates client and server, the server simulates the os which gets requests from threads to use memory, and allocates the memory using part 2 and the basic algorithms of part 1. the client simulates the threads, and send requests to get memory pages.
### part 4
at this part I added gui system which lets the user run the client side with clever and intuitive user interface
